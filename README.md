# Advent of Code 2024
My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2024.  
Language: C#  
It's my first time, & I am a bit late to the party... Let's see how it goes!

## Structure
[AdventOfCode.Template](https://github.com/eduherminio/AdventOfCode.Template?tab=readme-ov-file) was used as a reference for base project structure.  

### Input
Eric, the author of Advent of Code, [asks for inputs not to be shared](https://x.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081).  
I've used [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) ([tutorial](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/encrypting.html)) to have inputs encrypted in the remote repo (GitHub at the time of writing) & decrypted on my local repo (where I have the key).   
If you want to test my solutions for yourself, replace the inputs with your own.
